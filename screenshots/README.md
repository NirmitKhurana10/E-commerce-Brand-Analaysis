# Screenshot Instructions

This README uses a combination of **generated diagrams** (already included) and **optional placeholders** for real business examples from your presentation.

## ✅ Already Included (Generated Diagrams)

These diagrams have been created and are already in the `screenshots/` folder:

1. **`information_levels.png`** - Shows the hierarchy of existing vs. new information at PMA/FSA levels
2. **`technical_architecture.png`** - EPISOD data framework and event flow diagram
3. **`customer_journey.png`** - Customer buying journey map across digital touchpoints

## 📸 Optional Screenshots to Add

If you want to include real business examples from your presentation, you can add sanitized screenshots for:

### 1. Business Navigation Report
- **File**: `business_navigation_report.png`
- **Source**: Slide showing the performance metrics table
- **What to sanitize**: Remove company logos/branding
- **Shows**: Metrics table with sales, sessions, conversion rates, add-to-cart rates

### 2. Geographic Performance Charts
- **File**: `geographic_performance.png`
- **Source**: Slide showing city/FSA performance charts
- **What to sanitize**: Remove company logos, consider anonymizing specific location names if needed
- **Shows**: Bar charts comparing tracked sessions and revenue by location

### 3. Product Insights Use Case
- **File**: `product_insights_use_case.png`
- **Source**: Slide showing how online insights increase in-store sales

- **Shows**: Visual example of the merchandising strategy

## 🔧 How to Add Optional Screenshots

1. Export the relevant slides from your presentation as images
2. Use an image editor to remove all company branding (logos, colors if distinctive)
3. Save the sanitized images with the filenames listed above
4. Place them in the `screenshots/` folder
5. Uncomment the relevant lines in the README.md file

For example, to add the business navigation report:
```markdown
<!-- Remove these comment markers -->
![Performance Dashboard](./screenshots/business_navigation_report.png)
*Figure 4: Business Navigation Online Performance Report with key metrics*
```

## ✨ Result

Your README will look professional with:
- Custom-generated diagrams showing the technical architecture
- Optional real business examples showing actual results (if you choose to add them)
- No company-specific branding or sensitive information
